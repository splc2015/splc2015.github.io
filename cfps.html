                                        The Software Product Line Conference (SPLC) is the premier forum for practitioners,
                                        researchers and educators to present and discuss the most recent ideas,
                                        innovations, trends, experiences, and concerns in the area of software
                                        product lines, software product family engineering and, more in general,
                                        systems family engineering. SPLC 2015 will be the 19th meeting of the product
                                        line community and will be held in Tennessee, USA, 20 to 24 July.

                                        We propose you to collaborate in this forum by submitting proposals for
                                        one or two day’s interactive and collaborative workshops in the field of
                                        software product lines. Those workshops should be targeting innovative,
                                        emerging and interesting research areas within the context of software
                                        product lines. The aim of SPLC workshops should be to incentive the collaboration
                                        in between multiple software product line researchers and practitioners
                                        interested in specific areas rather than mini-conferences.

                                        Workshops usually take place on the first and second day of the conference,
                                        thus, 20th and 21st July’15. SPLC workshop papers are published in volume
                                        2 of the SPLC conference proceedings published by ACM. Moreover, a one-page
                                        summary of each accepted workshop will be published in volume 1.

                                        Tutorials provide a valuable opportunity for conference participants to
                                        expand their product line knowledge and skills. Tutorials may focus on
                                        introductory product line topics, such as how to introduce a product line
                                        approach into an organization, or on more advanced applied topics, such
                                        as industrial product line engineering practices.

                                        Tutorials will be held during the conference week in full-day or half-day
                                        sessions. A tutorial proposal consists of two pages describing the topic,
                                        the plan for conducting the tutorial, and the backgrounds of the presenters
                                        and the tutorial.

                                        Industrial participation is and has always been a strong aspect of SPLC and the upcoming event will be no exception to this tradition. So we invite your contributions to discuss challenges, innovations and solutions to concrete industrial applications of software and system product line engineering tools and methodologies.
                                    </p>

                                        For more than a decade, organizations have been taking advantage of software product line practices to achieve business advantages in time to market, cost, quality, and agility.
These organizations have encountered a wide range of challenges, successes, and adaptations in their software product line experience. We are seeking contributions from industry that share those challenges, successes, and adaptations during all stages of software product line maturity-ranging from adoption to evolution.

                                        The Software Product Line Conference (SPLC) is a premier forum where researchers, practitioners, and educators can present and discuss the most recent ideas, trends, experiences, and challenges in the area of software and system product lines engineering.

                                        The SPLC 2015 Demonstrations and Tools track provides an opportunity for live demonstrations of product line tools and practices tackling current industrial challenges. We invite proposals for demonstrations of academic, open source, in-house, and commercial tools that support and automate any aspect of product line engineering. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to, feature modeling, variant management, validation and verification, derivation and generation of products, product line testing, and product line analysis. 
                                    </p>

                                        Demonstrations of original, novel tools, of existing tools with new contributions, and of customized extensions of standard tools are welcome. We invite demonstrations of both early implementations and mature products.  Commercial tool vendors are encouraged to demonstrate their tools together with an industrial customer using concrete examples. Each tool demonstration should explain how the tool could be used to solve real-life problems with a use case.
                                    </p>

                                        In addition to tool demonstrations, we are interested in proposals for demonstrations of industrial product line practice. Of special interest are practices, which are currently not sufficiently supported by tools. Demonstrations should illustrate the state of the practice in product line engineering and should communicate the existing practice, assumptions behind the approach, and actual or potential limitations and challenges. Both successful and unsuccessful practices may be shared.

                                        Submissions will be evaluated according to the relevance and originality of the work as well as presentation quality. Work that has not been previously presented at SPLC is given a priority.
Tools previously presented at SPLC should include a description of new features of the tool or new aspects to be presented. The proposal should highlight what insight the audience would get from the presentation.
