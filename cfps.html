                           <p>The Software Product Line Conference (SPLC) is a premier forum where researchers, practitioners, and educators can present and discuss the most recent ideas, trends, experiences, and challenges in the area of software and system product lines engineering. In 2015, SPLC will be held in Nashville, TN.</p>
                           <p>There are four tracks associated with standard papers and oral presentations. SPLC’s traditional core topics associated with software product lines are the focus of the Research and Industry Tracks. In addition, SPLC 15 features a new System Engineering Track focused on system engineering product line topics. These three tracks are intended to present recent and current work. Finally, a new Vision Track has been added with a focus on the future, discussing trends, emerging directions, and synergies with fields outside traditional software and system product line communities.</p>

                           <h4>Goals</h4>
                           <p> The goal of the SPLC Vision Track 2015 is to look to the future of software and system product lines, discussing trends, emerging directions, and synergies with fields outside traditional software and system product line communities. The Vision Track encourages discussion of radical new directions and potentially disruptive software and system engineering innovations. To support that goal, the Vision Track will publish three kinds of papers:</p>
                           <p> 
                           <ol>
                              <li>
                                 Reaching out principles and practices from software product lines to other fields, such as: 
                                 <ul>
                                    <li>Core assets + variability = the fabric of self-adaptive systems</li>
                                    <li>Runtime variability as a first-class citizen to manage uncertainty</li>
                                    <li>Variant binding and binding time as key principles to manage the blurring boundaries between development time and run time </li>

                                 <ul>
                                    <li>Papers that call existing views into questions and suggest to change perspectives</li>
                                    <li>Results that disregard established results and call for fundamentally new directions</li>
                                    <li>Interdisciplinary efforts with potential unusual synergies</li>
                                    <li>Software ecosystems  </li>

                              Vision Track submissions must clearly motivate and illustrate a rationale for changing current practice and/or research in software product lines engineering or related fields. We solicit long papers (up to 10 pages) and short papers (up to 5 pages). Long papers for the Vision Track require supporting evidence for the claims made; short papers do not require evaluation results but can optionally be presented.

                           <h4> Scope </h4>
                           <p>
                              The SPLC Vision Track provides a forum for innovative, thought-provoking directions in software and system product lines aiming to accelerate the exposure of the community to promising and potentially inspiring research and engineering efforts. Contributions should provide novel, soundly motivated research and engineering directions and emerging results.
                           </p>
                        </div>

                           <p>
                              A Vision Track submission should not be a position statement or an SPLC research submission that lacks sufficient evaluation. Vision Track papers are fundamentally different in nature, focusing on future trends and directions.

                        <h3> Systems Engineering Track Call for Papers  </h3>
                        <div>
                           <p> While SPLC has always targeted systems as well as software product line engineering, SPLC 2015 introduces a new track explicitly aimed at product lines residing primarily in the systems engineering realm.</p>
                           <p> The International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) defines SE as an interdisciplinary approach and means to enable the realization of successful systems. It concerns operations, cost and schedule, performance, training and support, test, technical considerations.</p>
                           <p> This track solicits papers, either research-oriented or industry-oriented, that are explicitly aimed at product lines residing primarily in the <i>Systems Engineering</i> realm.  Specifically, this track is for papers addressing product line engineering where the focus extends beyond software and into other lifecycle phases (design, testing, mechanical, electrical, operations, portfolio management, manufacturing, etc.) and/or concerns across the whole organization.  Industry or research papers focusing primarily on <i>software</i> product lines should be submitted to the standard industry and research tracks.</p>

                        <h3> Call for Workshop Proposals </h3>
                        <div>
                           <p> The Software Product Line Conference (SPLC) is the premier forum for practitioners, researchers and educators to present and discuss the most recent ideas, innovations, trends, experiences, and concerns in the area of software product lines, software product family engineering and, more in general, systems family engineering. SPLC 2015 will be the 19th meeting of the product line community and will be held in Tennessee, USA, 20 to 24 July. </p>
                           <p> We propose you to collaborate in this forum by submitting proposals for one or two day’s interactive and collaborative workshops in the field of software product lines. Those workshops should be targeting innovative, emerging and interesting research areas within the context of software product lines. The aim of SPLC workshops should be to incentive the collaboration in between multiple software product line researchers and practitioners interested in specific areas rather than mini-conferences. </p>
                           <p> Workshops usually take place on the first and second day of the conference, thus, 20th and 21st July’15. SPLC workshop papers are published in volume 2 of the SPLC conference proceedings published by ACM. Moreover, a one-page summary of each accepted workshop will be published in volume 1. </p>
                           <p> Workshop proposals should be authored by at least two organizers, preferably from different institutions, and they should contain the following three sections: </p>

                        <div>
                           <p> Tutorials provide a valuable opportunity for conference participants to expand their product line knowledge and skills. Tutorials may focus on introductory product line topics, such as how to introduce a product line approach into an organization, or on more advanced applied topics, such as industrial product line engineering practices. </p>
                           <p> This year, we would like to place special emphasis on the following areas: </p>
                           <ol>
                              <li> The practical adoption of SPL skills, tools, and processes in industry; </li>
                              <li> In-depth discussions of advanced SPLE topics (e.g., agile practices, ecosystem modeling, application platforms); </li>
                              <li> SPL in the context of The Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems. </li>
                           </ol>

                           <p> Tutorials will be held during the conference week in full-day or half-day sessions. A tutorial proposal consists of two pages describing the topic, the plan for conducting the tutorial, and the backgrounds of the presenters and the tutorial. </p>
                           <ul>
                              <li> The Topic section should include the title, goals, and intended audience of the tutorial (practical vs. academic; beginners vs. advances). The topic should be described in detail, stressing its importance and timeliness. </li>
                              <li>
                                 The Plan section should include: 
                                 <ul>
                                    <li> A preliminary schedule of events including estimated times and length of the tutorial (half-day/full-day); </li>
                                    <li> A detailed description of what the tutorial will cover; </li>

                        <h3> Call for Doctoral Symposium </h3>
                        <div>
                           <p> The SPLC Doctoral Symposium aims to provide a supportive environment that enables doctoral students to get feedback on and improve their research. Students will have the opportunity to discuss their work with experienced members of the community. Thus, the symposium offers a unique opportunity to gather valuable expert feedback and to get into contact with other students in the same field. The overall aim of the symposium is to improve the quality of doctoral theses in the area of software product lines. The event is dedicated to Ph.D. candidates (2nd year or later) with initial results that are not yet mature enough for a full conference paper. The SPLC doctoral symposium covers the same research topics as the main conference. </p>

                           <h4> Part I: Research Plan </h4>
                           <p> To participate, students should prepare a research plan answering the following questions: </p>
                           <p> 
                           <ul>
                              <li><b>What </b>is the problem you intend to investigate?</li>
                              <li><b>Why </b>is the work important?</li>
                              <li><b>How </b>are you going to do the work?</li>
                              <li><b>When </b>what has already been done and what remains to be done?</li>
                           </ul>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              In detail, the following structure and content is strongly recommended:

                              <br/>
                              Introduction (area of study); description of the problem (that you tackle); what the
                              literature says about this problem (where does existing work fail?); how you (plan to) tackle this problem; how you (plan to) implement your solution/envisioned result; how you (plan to) validate your solution.

                              <br/>
                              The research method(s) you are using or plan to use, with appropriate references.
                              <br/>
                              The research design: how you concretely plan to apply the method(s), e.g., data collection and analysis, set-up for measurements/experiments, case studies, etc.
                              <br/>How do you plan to evaluate your results? Threats to validity?

                              <br/>
                              The idea of the research plan is to provide clear material to be useful as a basis for guidance and discussion. Therefore, students should think about the above points carefully and try to make their ideas as concrete and clear as possible. Students at relatively early stages of their research will certainly have difficulty addressing some of these, but should still attempt to do the best they can. It is strongly recommended that students discuss these points with their supervisors!

We invite proposals for demonstrations of academic, open source, in-house, and commercial tools that support and automate any aspect of product line engineering. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to, feature modeling, variant management, validation and verification, derivation and generation of products, product line testing, and product line analysis. </p>
                           <p> Demonstrations of original, novel tools, of existing tools with new contributions, and of customized extensions of standard tools are welcome. We invite demonstrations of both early implementations and mature products. Commercial tool vendors are encouraged to demonstrate their tools together with an industrial customer using concrete examples. Each tool demonstration should explain how the tool could be used to solve real-life problems with a use case. </p>
                           <p> In addition to tool demonstrations, we are interested in proposals for demonstrations of industrial product line practice. Of special interest are practices, which are currently not sufficiently supported by tools. Demonstrations should illustrate the state of the practice in product line engineering and should communicate the existing practice, assumptions behind the approach, and actual or potential limitations and challenges. Both successful and unsuccessful practices may be shared. </p>

                           <p> Submissions will be evaluated according to the relevance and originality of the work as well as presentation quality. Work that has not been previously presented at SPLC is given a priority. Tools previously presented at SPLC should include a description of new features of the tool or new aspects to be presented. The proposal should highlight what insight the audience would get from the presentation. </p>
